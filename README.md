# `1. Project Structure Practices`

## ![✔] 1.1 Structure your solution by components

**TL;DR:** The worst large applications pitfall is maintaining a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies - such a monolith slows down developers as they try to incorporate new features. Instead, partition your code into components, each gets its own folder or a dedicated codebase, and ensure that each unit is kept small and simple.

**Otherwise:** When developers who code new features struggle to realize the impact of their change and fear to break other dependent components - deployments become slower and riskier. It's also considered harder to scale-out when all the business units are not separated.

For medium sized apps and above, monoliths are really bad - having one big software with many dependencies is just hard to reason about and often leads to spaghetti code. Even smart architects — those who are skilled enough to tame the beast and 'modularize' it — spend great mental effort on design, and each change requires carefully evaluating the impact on other dependent objects. The ultimate solution is to develop small software: divide the whole stack into self-contained components that don't share files with others, each constitutes very few files (e.g. API, service, data access, test, etc.) so that it's very easy to reason about it. Some may call this 'microservices' architecture — it's important to understand that microservices are not a spec which you must follow, but rather a set of principles. You may adopt many principles into a full-blown microservices architecture or adopt only a few. Both are good as long as you keep the software complexity low. The very least you should do is create basic borders between components, assign a folder in your project root for each business component and make it self-contained - other components are allowed to consume its functionality only through its public interface or API. This is the foundation for keeping your components simple, avoid dependency hell and pave the way to full-blown microservices in the future once your app grows.
